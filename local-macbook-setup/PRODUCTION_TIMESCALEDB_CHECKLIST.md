# Production-Grade TimescaleDB Deployment Checklist

This checklist ensures your TimescaleDB deployment meets production standards with zero data loss.

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Data Preservation Requirements
- [ ] **CONFIRMED**: Product owner requirement for zero data loss
- [ ] **VERIFIED**: No retention policies enabled (data preserved indefinitely)
- [ ] **TESTED**: Compression is lossless and preserves all data
- [ ] **DOCUMENTED**: Data preservation policy in place

### 2. Resource Allocation
- [ ] **MEMORY**: PostgreSQL container allocated 2GB RAM minimum
- [ ] **CPU**: Sufficient CPU cores for background workers (16 workers configured)
- [ ] **STORAGE**: Adequate disk space for uncompressed + compressed data
- [ ] **NETWORK**: Stable network connectivity for container communication

### 3. Configuration Validation
- [ ] **DOCKER IMAGE**: Using `timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg15`
- [ ] **EXTENSIONS**: TimescaleDB extension enabled
- [ ] **PARAMETERS**: Production-grade PostgreSQL parameters configured
- [ ] **ENVIRONMENT**: All required environment variables set

## âœ… Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/ronalddelacruz/Documents/augment-projects/prs/prs-production-deployment/local-macbook-setup

# Verify environment configuration
cat .env | grep -E "(POSTGRES|TIMESCALE)"

# Expected values:
# POSTGRES_MEMORY_LIMIT=2g
# POSTGRES_SHARED_BUFFERS=256MB
# POSTGRES_EFFECTIVE_CACHE_SIZE=1GB
# TIMESCALEDB_MAX_BACKGROUND_WORKERS=16
```

### 2. Deploy with TimescaleDB
```bash
# Full deployment with TimescaleDB
./scripts/deploy-local.sh deploy

# Verify services are running
./scripts/deploy-local.sh status
```

### 3. Verify TimescaleDB Setup
```bash
# Check TimescaleDB status
./scripts/deploy-local.sh timescaledb-status

# Expected output:
# - TimescaleDB version information
# - List of hypertables (10 tables)
# - Compression policies (no retention policies)
# - Background jobs running
```

## âœ… Post-Deployment Validation

### 1. Data Integrity Checks
```bash
# Validate data integrity
./scripts/timescaledb-production-tools.sh validate

# Check for:
# - All hypertables created successfully
# - Foreign key constraints intact
# - No missing chunks
# - Data consistency across tables
```

### 2. Performance Verification
```bash
# Run health check
./scripts/deploy-local.sh timescaledb-health

# Verify:
# - Query performance improvements
# - Compression ratios
# - Background job status
# - Storage optimization
```

### 3. Backup Validation
```bash
# Create initial backup
./scripts/deploy-local.sh timescaledb-backup

# Verify backup files created:
# - Binary format (.dump)
# - SQL format (.sql)
# - Both files in backups/ directory
```

## âœ… Production Monitoring Setup

### 1. Health Monitoring
```bash
# Set up regular health checks (add to cron if needed)
./scripts/timescaledb-production-tools.sh health

# Monitor:
# - Database size growth
# - Compression effectiveness
# - Query performance
# - Background job status
```

### 2. Storage Monitoring
```bash
# Monitor storage usage
./scripts/timescaledb-production-tools.sh storage

# Track:
# - Total database size
# - Compression savings
# - Chunk distribution
# - Growth trends
```

### 3. Performance Optimization
```bash
# Regular optimization (weekly recommended)
./scripts/deploy-local.sh timescaledb-optimize

# Includes:
# - Statistics updates
# - Continuous aggregate refresh
# - Compression job execution
```

## âœ… Backup and Recovery Strategy

### 1. Regular Backups
```bash
# Create production backup
./scripts/deploy-local.sh timescaledb-backup

# Backup includes:
# - All data (no data loss)
# - TimescaleDB metadata
# - Hypertable configurations
# - Compression settings
```

### 2. Backup Schedule Recommendation
- **Daily**: Automated backups during low-usage hours
- **Weekly**: Full validation and optimization
- **Monthly**: Archive old backups, storage review

### 3. Recovery Testing
- [ ] **TESTED**: Backup restoration process
- [ ] **VERIFIED**: All data recoverable
- [ ] **DOCUMENTED**: Recovery procedures
- [ ] **VALIDATED**: RTO/RPO requirements met

## âœ… Security and Compliance

### 1. Data Security
- [ ] **ENCRYPTION**: Database encryption at rest (if required)
- [ ] **ACCESS**: Proper user permissions and roles
- [ ] **NETWORK**: Secure network configuration
- [ ] **AUDIT**: Audit logging enabled

### 2. Compliance Requirements
- [ ] **RETENTION**: Zero data loss policy implemented
- [ ] **BACKUP**: Regular backup schedule established
- [ ] **MONITORING**: Health monitoring in place
- [ ] **DOCUMENTATION**: All procedures documented

## âœ… Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. TimescaleDB Extension Not Found
```bash
# Check if using correct Docker image
docker-compose ps postgres
# Should show: timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg15

# Restart with correct image
./scripts/deploy-local.sh rebuild
```

#### 2. Hypertables Not Created
```bash
# Manually run TimescaleDB setup
./scripts/deploy-local.sh setup-timescaledb

# Check hypertable status
./scripts/deploy-local.sh timescaledb-status
```

#### 3. Performance Issues
```bash
# Run optimization
./scripts/deploy-local.sh timescaledb-optimize

# Check resource usage
docker stats prs-local-postgres-timescale

# Verify memory allocation
cat .env | grep POSTGRES_MEMORY_LIMIT
```

#### 4. Storage Growth Concerns
```bash
# Check compression effectiveness
./scripts/timescaledb-production-tools.sh storage

# Manually run compression
./scripts/deploy-local.sh timescaledb-optimize
```

## âœ… Success Criteria

### Deployment is successful when:
- [ ] All services running without errors
- [ ] TimescaleDB extension enabled and functional
- [ ] All 10 hypertables created successfully
- [ ] Compression policies active (no retention policies)
- [ ] Backup system operational
- [ ] Health monitoring functional
- [ ] Performance improvements measurable
- [ ] Zero data loss confirmed

### Performance Benchmarks:
- [ ] Time-based queries 50-90% faster than standard PostgreSQL
- [ ] Storage compression achieving 30-70% space savings
- [ ] Background jobs running without errors
- [ ] Query response times under acceptable thresholds

## ðŸ“ž Support and Maintenance

### Regular Maintenance Tasks:
1. **Weekly**: Run optimization and health checks
2. **Monthly**: Review storage usage and compression effectiveness
3. **Quarterly**: Validate backup and recovery procedures
4. **Annually**: Review configuration and upgrade planning

### Monitoring Alerts:
- Database size growth exceeding thresholds
- Compression job failures
- Query performance degradation
- Background worker issues

### Documentation Updates:
- Keep this checklist updated with any configuration changes
- Document any custom optimizations or configurations
- Maintain backup and recovery procedures
- Update monitoring thresholds as needed

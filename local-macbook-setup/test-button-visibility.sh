echo "📋 Requisition $RS_ID should show Force Close button because:"
echo "  ✅ Status: rs_in_progress"
echo "  ✅ User: ronald (requester)"
echo "  ✅ Button visibility: true (from API)"
echo ""

echo "🌐 Please check the browser at:"
echo "  https://localhost:8444/dashboard/requisitions/$RS_ID"
echo ""

echo "🔍 Expected behavior:"
echo "  ✅ Force Close button should be visible"
echo "  ✅ Button should be red with 'Force Close' text"
echo "  ✅ Clicking button should open modal (even if not eligible)"
echo "  ❌ Modal should show eligibility error when trying to execute"

echo "📝 The fix changed frontend logic from:"
echo "  OLD: Show button only if (isRequestor && isEligible && status === 'rs_in_progress')"
echo "  NEW: Show button if (isRequestor && status === 'rs_in_progress')"

echo "✅ Force close validation issues have been fixed:"
echo "  ✅ Removed hardcoded requisition ID"
echo "  ✅ Fixed PO status case sensitivity"
